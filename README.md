# OrderApp
OrderApp is the "Working with the Web" chapter guided project in "Develop in Swift Data Collections" by Apple. It combines all of the chapter 2 topics (closures, extensions, basic animations, network requests, JSON encoding, concurrency) along with some new topics (type aliases, POST requests, NumberFormatters, singletons, NotificationCenter) to create a restaurant ordering app utilizing a local server's API to GET and POST information.

The initial commit contains the completed main goals of the project (along with personal code comments), and subsequent commits include the optional stretch goals.

There is a bug with the server app (created by Apple and included with the source) that prevents images from being loaded properly, so only the placeholder images are utilized.
